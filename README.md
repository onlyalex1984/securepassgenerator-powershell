## Installation

There are three ways to install and use SecurePassGenerator:

### Method 1: Using the Interactive Installer (Recommended)

The easiest way to get started with SecurePassGenerator:

1. Download and extract the ZIP file from the [releases page](https://github.com/onlyalex1984/securepassgenerator-powershell/releases)
2. Locate `RUN_ME_FIRST.bat` in the extracted folder
3. Right-click the file and select "Properties"
4. At the bottom of the Properties window, check the "Unblock" box and click OK
5. Double-click `RUN_ME_FIRST.bat` to run the installer
6. Follow the interactive menu to choose between offline or online installation
7. A desktop shortcut will be created automatically

The installer offers two options:

- **Offline Installation**: Uses the included files (no internet required)
- **Online Installation**: Downloads the latest version from GitHub

For more details, see the [Installer README](tools/installer/README.md).

### Method 2: Direct Execution

For users who prefer to run the script directly:

1. Download and extract the ZIP file from the [releases page](https://github.com/onlyalex1984/securepassgenerator-powershell/releases)
2. Locate `SecurePassGenerator.ps1` in the extracted folder
3. Right-click the file and select "Properties"
4. At the bottom of the Properties window, check the "Unblock" box and click OK
5. Open PowerShell or Command Prompt
6. Navigate to the folder where you extracted the files
7. Run the script with execution policy bypass:
   ```powershell
   powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File ".\SecurePassGenerator.ps1"
   ```

This method runs the script directly without modifying any system settings and without creating a desktop shortcut.

### Method 3: From Repository Source

For developers or those who want the latest code:

1. Clone the repository or download the source code from GitHub:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/onlyalex1984/securepassgenerator-powershell.git
   ```
   Or use the "Download ZIP" option from the GitHub repository page and extract it
2. Navigate to the repository folder
3. Right-click the `SecurePassGenerator.ps1` file and select "Properties"
4. At the bottom of the Properties window, check the "Unblock" box and click OK (Windows often blocks downloaded files for security)
5. Run the script with execution policy bypass:
   ```powershell
   powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File ".\SecurePassGenerator.ps1"
   ```

Alternatively, you can use the installer in the `tools/installer/` directory:

1. Navigate to `tools/installer/` in the repository
2. Locate `RUN_ME_FIRST.bat`
3. Right-click the file and select "Properties"
4. At the bottom of the Properties window, check the "Unblock" box and click OK (Windows often blocks downloaded files for security)
5. Run the installer by double-clicking it
6. Follow the interactive menu to choose between offline or online installation
7. A desktop shortcut will be created automatically

## Included Tools

### Interactive Installer

- **Location**: `tools\installer\RUN_ME_FIRST.bat`
- **Purpose**: Provides flexible installation options
- **Features**:
  - Offline and online installation options
  - Automatic desktop shortcut creation
  - Fallback mechanisms for reliable installation

For more information, see the [Installer README](tools/installer/README.md).

## API Integration

SecurePassGenerator integrates with two external APIs:

### Have I Been Pwned

- Checks if passwords have appeared in data breaches
- Uses k-anonymity model for secure checking (only the first 5 characters of the password hash are sent)
- Provides count of breaches if found
- Implements rate limiting to respect API service limitations

### Password Pusher

- Secure password sharing service
- Supports various expiration options
- Multiple retrieval methods (including QR codes)
- Includes cooldown periods between requests to prevent abuse
- Dual API methods (Direct and Curl) for improved reliability
- Service availability checking before API calls

## Security Considerations

- **Zero Storage**: No passwords are stored locally
- **Secure Transmission**: Passwords are only transmitted when explicitly shared via Password Pusher
- **HTTPS Only**: All API interactions use secure methods
- **Local Processing**: Password entropy calculation is performed locally
- **Privacy Protection**: Have I Been Pwned API checks use the k-anonymity model
- **API Protection**: Rate limiting is implemented to prevent API abuse
- **Service Unavailability Handling**: Graceful handling when external services are unavailable

  ### Service Unavailability Detection:

  ![Service Unavailability](screenshots/service_unavailable.png)

- **Cooldown Timers**: 10-second cooldowns implemented for both HIBP and Password Pusher to prevent excessive API calls
